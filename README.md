# Uncovering the mechanisms of Pt catalyst restructuring under a pressure of gas

# Basin Hopping Data
All the structural data (trajectory files including the positions, energy and force information) used for training & validation of HDNNP and the data  generated from Basin Hopping simulations has been included also as a `NOMAD dataset`.

`free_energy_plot.py` script generates Adsorption Energy vs CO Coverage plots and minima energy structures at each coverage for 450 Torr (mu_15.33), 0.5 Torr (mu_15.5) and 0.0007 Torr (mu_15.68). The minima strucutres are used to understand restructuring.
